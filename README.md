## State

The application state is an alpha state with some unfinished tasks. It contains a lot of features derived from my previous Mojo version of Google Maps for webOS.
It is tested physically only on HP Pre3, where is implemented also a compass feature.
You can search places, get directions, use street view, launch Navit from popup menu etc. Check also the settings and more maptypes.
